[English](./README.md) | [中文](./readme-cn.md)

## Overview

`auto-coder-chat-lite` is a lightweight tool designed to facilitate code chat and project scaffolding. It provides a command-line interface for interacting with the project, allowing users to add, remove, and list files, as well as request AI-based code modifications.

## Installation

To install `auto-coder-chat-lite`, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, you can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install auto-coder-chat-lite
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the tool using the following commands:

### `chat.code`

```bash
chat.code
```

This command starts the interactive command-line interface for code chat and project scaffolding. You can use the following commands within this interface:

- `/add_files <file1> <file2> ...` - Add files to the current session.
- `/remove_files <file1> <file2> ...` - Remove files from the current session.
- `/list_files` - List all active files in the current session.
- `/coding <query>` - Request the AI to modify code based on requirements.
- `/exclude_dirs <dir1> <dir2> ...` - Exclude directories from file searches.
- `/conf [<key> [<value>]]` - View or set configuration options.
- `/commit_message` - Generate a commit message based on Git diff.
- `/help` - Show this help message.
- `/exit` - Exit the program.

### `chat.prompt`

```bash
chat.prompt
```

This command is used to render a template using Jinja2. It requires two arguments:

- `template_path`: Path to the template file.
- `text_path`: Path to the text file to be used as content.

Optionally, you can specify an output file path using the `-o` or `--output_path` flag (default is `output.txt`).

Example usage:

```bash
chat.prompt path/to/template.txt path/to/content.txt -o path/to/output.txt
```

This command will render the template with the provided content, save the result to the specified output file, and copy the rendered content to the clipboard.
